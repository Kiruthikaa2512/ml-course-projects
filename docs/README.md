# Chocolate Sales Dataset

This dataset contains transactional sales data for chocolate products across multiple countries and product types. It includes shipment volumes, sales amounts, and product details, and was used to explore demand prediction using machine learning.

## Columns

- `Date`: Transaction date
- `Country`: Destination country
- `Product`: Chocolate product name
- `Boxes Shipped`: Quantity shipped
- `Amount`: Total sales amount (in USD)
- `Inventory`: Remaining stock after shipment (if available)

## Purpose

Used in Lab 1 to explore sales behavior and build a regression model to predict demand (`Amount`) based on product type, country, and shipment volume.  
Supports experimentation with feature engineering, log transformations, and model evaluation.
